## ✅ **Completed Technical Changes**

### 1. Removed Artifacts Collection Completely
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Files Modified:**
- Deleted: `apps/web/src/app/artifacts/page.tsx` and `apps/web/src/app/artifacts/[slug]/page.tsx`
- Updated: `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts` - Replaced Artifact interface with ArchiveItem
- Updated: `apps/astro/src/lib/payload.ts` - Replaced getArtifacts with getArchiveItems
- Updated: `apps/cms/src/blocks/Archive.ts` - Changed relationTo from 'artifacts' to 'archive-items'
- Updated: `apps/web/src/components/blocks/ArchiveBlock.tsx` - Updated switch case
- Updated: `apps/cms/src/components/blocks/ArchiveBlock.tsx` - Updated switch case
- Updated: `apps/astro/src/components/blocks/ArchiveBlock.astro` - Updated paths
- Updated: `apps/web/src/components/CollectionRenderer.tsx` - Updated field references
- Updated: `apps/cms/src/components/CollectionRenderer.tsx` - Updated field references
- Updated: `apps/astro/src/pages/collections/[slug].astro` - Updated field references

### 2. Navigation Endpoint Updated
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**File:** `apps/cms/src/endpoints/navigation.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added `Taxonomy` section to sectionOrder array
- Created `taxonomySlugs` array: ['categories', 'tags']
- Created `shopSlugs` array: ['products', 'product-categories', 'product-collections']
- Removed nested collections from Posts (categories/tags no longer nested)
- Added separate Taxonomy section building logic
- Shop section now separate from Collections section

**Result:** Navigation now shows:
```
Dashboard → Content → Taxonomy → Collections → Shop → Media → Forms → Settings → Admin
```

### 3. Collection Navigation Manager Added
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Files Added/Updated:**
- Added: `apps/cms/src/globals/NavigationSettings.ts`
- Added: `apps/cms/src/components/CollectionManagerField.tsx`
- Added: `apps/cms/src/endpoints/collectionManager.ts`
- Updated: `apps/cms/src/endpoints/navigation.ts` - Applies visibility, section, and ordering overrides
- Updated: `apps/cms/src/admin/views/Tools.tsx` - Added Navigation Manager link
- Updated: `apps/cms/src/app/(payload)/custom.scss` - Manager UI styles

**Result:** Admins can toggle visibility, reorder collections, and change sections without code changes.

## ❌ **Outstanding Technical Issues**

### 1. Menu Flashing on Navigation
**Problem:** Navigation component unmounts/remounts when navigating between pages
**Cause:** Payload's routing causes full page reload
**Impact:** Minor UX issue - menu briefly disappears
**Status:** Partially mitigated by caching and client-side links (nav still remounts)

**Possible Solutions:**
- Use Next.js Link component instead of `<a>` tags (implemented)
- Keep navigation in a persistent layout component
- Accept as Payload's default behaviour

### 2. Nested Items Inaccessible on Mobile
**Problem:** When sidebar is collapsed on mobile, nested items are hidden
**Affected:** Product Categories/Collections (under Products)
**Note:** Categories/Tags now in separate Taxonomy section, so this is less critical
**Status:** ✅ Resolved via Option A (nested links remain visible when collapsed)

**Recommended Solutions (in order of preference):**

**Option A: Always Show Nested Items (SIMPLE - 5 minutes)**
Applied in `custom.scss` by removing the collapsed rule that hid nested links.
Pros: Quick fix, no code complexity
Cons: Might look cluttered on mobile

**Option B: Add Buttons to Collection Pages (BETTER UX - 1-2 hours)**
Add "Manage Categories" and "Manage Tags" buttons to Posts/Products list views
```typescript
// apps/cms/src/collections/Posts.ts
admin: {
  components: {
    BeforeListTable: ['/admin/components/PostsListActions'],
  },
}
```
Pros: Better UX, clear access to nested collections
Cons: Requires custom Payload component

**Option C: Don't Auto-Collapse Sidebar on Mobile (SIMPLE)**
Let users manually collapse if needed
Pros: No hidden items
Cons: Takes up screen space on mobile

### 3. Collection Management Requires Code Changes
**Problem:** Can't add/remove/reorganize collections from CMS UI

**Current Process:**
- Adding new collections → Edit `payload.config.ts`
- Renaming collections → Edit multiple files + data migration
- Restart server required

**Now Available:**
- Enable/disable collections in navigation
- Reorder collections in navigation
- Move collections between sections

**Future Enhancement:** Adding/removing collections still requires code changes. Navigation ordering/visibility is now handled via the Collection Manager UI.

### 4. Museum Collections Should Be Renamed to Galleries
**Current:** `museum-collections`
**Desired:** `galleries`

**Why Not Done Yet:** Requires:
1. Renaming collection file
2. Updating slug in collection config
3. Updating all code references
4. Migrating existing data in database

**Impact:** Breaking change - requires careful data migration planning

## ❓ **FAQ - Common Questions Answered**

**Q: Can I add/remove/reorganize collections from the CMS admin without code changes?**
A: Partial. You can now reorder or hide collections in the navigation UI, but adding/removing collections still requires editing `payload.config.ts` and restarting.

**Q: Why does the menu still vanish when I navigate?**
A: Payload's routing causes the navigation component to unmount/remount. Caching helps but doesn't eliminate the flash. This is a Payload limitation that could be addressed with React Router integration.

**Q: Where is the artifacts collection? I can't see it in the CMS.**
A: It's been completely removed. Use `archive-items` instead - they're the same thing but more flexible.

**Q: Where is museum-collections? I can't see it to rename it.**
A: It exists as `museum-collections` in the code. Renaming to `galleries` requires renaming the collection file, updating the slug, updating all code references, and migrating database data. This is a breaking change that needs careful planning.

**Q: How do I create a custom collection type?**
A: Use the Archive Items template as a base and create a Custom Content Type. This allows you to add custom fields without duplicating code. See SHARED_TAXONOMY_SYSTEM.md for examples.
