- **Tools Page**: Centralized location for common tasks like SEO audits and media management.

### Frontend Selection

You can choose your frontend framework (Next.js or Astro) in the admin panel under **Settings > Frontend**. This setting determines which frontend is used for previews and can be used by your deployment scripts.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OpaceDigitalAgency/headless-cms.git
   cd headless-cms
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then, edit `.env` with your database credentials and a `PAYLOAD_SECRET`.

4. **Start the development servers:**
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```
   - CMS will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
   - Frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3001` (Next.js) or `http://localhost:4321` (Astro)

### Creating a New Project from a Preset

You can use the `make` commands to create a new project from a preset:

```bash
# Create a new blog project with Astro
make blog-astro

# Create a new museum site with Next.js
make museum-next

# Create a new ecommerce site with Next.js
make ecommerce-next

# Create a new brochure site with Astro
make brochure-astro
```

This will create a new directory with the selected preset, ready for you to customize.
